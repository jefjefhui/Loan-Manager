# Loan-Manager


Loan Manager 
The loan manager program will calculate the total amount you owe. Users need to enter the loan amount and the duration. After these two pieces of information are entered, the total amount you owe will be displayed.
The flow of the program is quite simple. When the program starts, it will ask for the loan amount. Afterwards, it will ask for the number of years. The loan manager program will calculate the amount you owe and show it to you. Afterwards, the program will ask the user and see if he/she wants to apply for another loan, the user can type “Y” or “N”. If the user types “Y”, the program will ask for loan amount and duration. Afterwards, it will show the amount you owe. If the user types “N”, it means there are no subsequent loans from the user, so the application will display all the loans and the sum. Afterwards, the program will terminate.
